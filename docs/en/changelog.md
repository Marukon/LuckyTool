### 1.3.5_beta

#### Added

- Force enable the Feiniu Cloud NAS option
- Custom system message region presets
- Disable malicious application intercept C16.1
- Disable accessibility warning dialog C16.1
- Remove Control Center carriers C16.1(400)
- Unlock GpsJoyStick Pro — unlocks the Pro features of Fake GPS Joystick (com.theappninjas.fakegpsjoystick)
- Remove Control Center settings button C16.1
- Disable audio focus
- Remove Breeno Next root detection C17 — bypasses the Root device restriction on the recruitment page
- Hide the status bar in panoramic AOD C16+ (@ShellWen) — only hides the status bar while the panoramic AOD is showing; the lock screen and normal screen are unaffected; restart System UI to take effect
- Optimize the application installation UI (@蛮吉)
- Custom notification side spacing C12+ — portrait and landscape can be configured separately
- Custom action key event interception (ringtone cycle) — adds “no-op” and “ringtone cycle” interception modes to custom action keys
- Manual scope hot reload — reload the scope process directly after changing a switch, without rebooting
- Expand the update list by default in the software store
- Miuix UI style — switch between the Material and Miuix appearances in Settings, defaulting to Miuix
- Cold-start animation — logo entrance and app-name fade-in
- Custom status bar icon order
- Force enable the Xiaobu keyboard liquid glass blur — ignores the system blur switch, the app whitelist, the built-in theme and the folding state; the blur strength is adjustable
- App permission page — checks the notification, all files access, app list and install app permissions, each granted by a button on its row; a cold start opens it until all four are granted (it only checks: no automatic request and no automatic jump to the system settings page), with Root status, root source, Xposed status and framework version pinned on top, and it offers no skip entry
- Custom status bar network speed refresh interval — off by default; adjustable from 0.1 s to 5 s in 0.1 s steps
- MEMC configuration Activity list supports searching and shows activity names
- Desktop layout backup and restore — from the launcher-related page, back up and restore icon positions, folders, the hotseat and the hidden-app state; periodic auto snapshots are written as .ltbackup files (a zip container holding meta.json and layout.json) to Download/LuckyTool/launcher_backup with the newest 20 kept; any snapshot in the history list can be deleted on its own (trailing button or long press)
- Classic Control Center tile rows and columns on ColorOS 17 — fixes the feature failing on ColorOS 17; the portrait row count and the column counts for both orientations stay freely configurable
- Control Center HDR/SDR ratio tile — mirrors the developer options switch of the same name and overlays the current HDR/SDR ratio on the top-right corner of the screen; A15+
- Custom video on the OTA card C17 — the card plays the selected video first and then returns to the custom background image; the video is muted and center-cropped to fill the card
- The custom OTA card background row previews the selected image
- The custom OTA card video row previews the first frame of the selected video
- Long press the custom OTA card background/video row to clear the selected file; with the video switch on but no video selected, the system video no longer takes over and the custom background image is shown instead

#### Optimized

- Redesigned the single-choice, multi-choice and action-list dialogs — all of them now go through one shared dialog component (a single implementation per appearance instead of two hand-written branches), the lists use the shared segmented cards, the selection shows as a trailing check mark or checkbox, and long lists scroll under a height cap instead of being squashed by the keyboard; module shortcuts are pinned per row through a trailing pin icon instead of reverse-inferring the selection, so the English “Only select one item” toast is gone; the touch sampling rate dialog disables OK while nothing is selected, so no invalid value is written
- Redesigned the app picker dialog — the search field stays on top, sort and filter moved into an inline panel behind the funnel icon, the list now uses the shared segmented cards, and a status row shows the app/selected counts with select-all in multi-select mode; also fixed selections being dropped when the search query is cleared
- Clarified the descriptions of the “app clone limit” options: “How many apps can be cloned” and “The number of clones a single app can have”
- The category rows on the function page now use colored badges — they previously resolved an app icon from the scope package name, which showed the battery icon for “Apps”; a new “Colorful category icons” switch falls back to single-color theme badges
- Settings backup/restore now records where each storage lives — both actions show a dialog with the current local/remote state, and restore writes back to the recorded place instead of silently falling back to local when remote storage is unavailable
- Settings backup and restore pickers default to Download/LuckyTool — both still go through the system file picker, only the picker's starting directory is preset to that folder (the backup suggests a timestamped file name), so the user still confirms the location and can change it; both dialogs share one layout (info / data targets / notes) with targets listed line by line, and the toast reports the actual file name

#### Fixed

- Fixed “Remove Breeno Next root detection” not taking effect, adapting to the new device-integrity probe in Breeno Next 17.0.75 — the probe result had been read backwards, so every device was reported as compromised
- Fixed “Remove app clone badge” not taking effect
- Fixed some selectors and switches not responding to taps
- Fixed the launcher crashing with sinking icons when the maximum number of columns is used C16
- Fixed crashes caused by scope optimizations C17 (@蛮吉)
- Fixed the wireless charging wattage display on the lock screen C17
- Fixed “Remove recent task list clear button” not taking effect C17
- Fixed “Remove the lock icon at the top of the lock screen” not taking effect C17
- Fixed data backup and restore for set values and legacy string formats; unwritable entries are skipped and the result now reports how many entries succeeded and failed
- Fixed donate data loading by switching to the jsDelivr mirror
- Fixed repeated permission requests and repeated jumps to the system settings page after returning from it — a cold start no longer requests permissions or jumps to the system settings page at all, the permission check only queries, and every grant starts from a button inside the page
- Fixed “Custom launcher layout rows/columns” not taking effect C17
- Fixed backups right after a reboot or a scope reload always timing out — the command is re-sent with a fresh token (up to 4 times) while the launcher process comes up, and the status row shows the attempt
- Fixed the “Use user typeface” switch doing nothing under the default network speed layout — the user typeface is now independent of the layout mode, so the default layout can swap just the typeface while text, size and spacing stay with the system
- Fixed “Force enable device controls tile” only producing a greyed-out tile on C17 — the hook now intercepts the source of the device controls master switch, restores the tile availability gate on C14 and later (which also carries a region check from C16), and no longer requires an installed controls provider app, so the tile state and the controller instances recover together
- Enable Wi-Fi details to display the gateway C16.1
- Disable automatic switching to the last task v16.6.17(8a73764)
- Remove the countdown for adding a virus app to the Phone Manager whitelist v17.3.10(c24156e)
- Migrated to libxposed API 102
- Custom fingerprint icon replacement C16.1
- Remove the personal hotspot power consumption notification C17 — no longer shows “turning on the personal hotspot for a long time increases power consumption and heat”
- Force recent task memory usage display C17
- Remove the widget add-request whitelist C17
- Long press a recent task icon to open app details C17
- Force Docker background blur C17
- Desktop page indicator component sliding C17
- Custom launcher icon size C17
- Control Center clock seconds display C17
- Status bar battery notification C17
- Enable Opex local installation C17
- Scan an NFC tag to click the button automatically C17
- 5G switch tile C17
- Force refresh rate C17 — conflicts with other dynamic refresh rate processes such as dfps
- Wi-Fi address information shows the gateway C17
- Remove the word limit for saving and renaming files v17.9.16(064a5da)
- Lock screen clock “red 1” style C17
- Remove the Notification Center clock C17
- Remove the rotate-screen button in the lower-left corner C17
- Remove the accessibility warning dialog C17
- Unlock the background task lock limit C17
- Remove the image save watermark of the Pictorial lock screen v40.10.15.2(4e15fb0)
- Enable the Smart Sidebar to keep running in the background C17 — an older version of the Smart Sidebar may be required
- Remove the battery restriction plugin C17
- Fix the clock disappearing behind the fluid cloud when the double-row layout or a custom format containing a line break is used — measure by the widest line and report that width to the fluid cloud; a “Clock minimum width” value is now honored as-is and re-applied whenever the fluid cloud capsule appears
- Fixed several customize options in the “About phone” group only appearing after the processor click page was set to a custom page
- Fixed the custom OTA card background being overwritten whenever the card refreshed, an easter egg video was shown or a video ended

#### Changed

- “Auto app archiving” is now disabled by default; it can be enabled in the settings when needed

#### Removed

- Removed “Notification Center two-side alignment” (adapted for C17 in this version, then removed)
- Removed the secure payment scope; the related restrictions can be turned off in the system secure payment settings
